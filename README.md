# üöÄ Automated Meeting Notes Workflow

End-to-end meeting summarization using **LangGraph**, open-source LLMs, and **LangSmith** for debugging and traceability.

---

## üìã Overview

This project automates the process of extracting **clear, actionable meeting notes** from any transcript.  
It uses a modular LangGraph architecture to:
- **Orchestrate** the transcript into logical sections
- **Synthesize** concise summaries for each section using an LLM
- Include a **human review step** for quality and context
- **Archive final notes** for sharing or compliance
- **Trace every step** with LangSmith for debugging and transparency

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

**Workflow Steps:**
1. **Input:** Paste or upload your raw meeting transcript (multi-speaker)
2. **Orchestrator Node:** Splits the transcript into meaningful chunks
3. **Synthesizer Node:** Summarizes each section using an LLM
4. **Human Review Node:** Lets a human approve or edit summaries (CLI prompt)
5. **Archive Node:** Saves the finalized notes for reference

Each step is **traced** and visualized in your LangSmith dashboard.

## üß© Example

**Sample Input:**
```
transcript = """
    Speaker 1: Good morning, everyone. Let's start with our Q3 project updates. 
    Speaker 2: Thanks, Speaker 1. The web app migration is almost done, but we've hit a snag with authentication‚ÄîOAuth tokens are expiring too soon.
    Speaker 3: We've had several user complaints about login issues. Should we escalate to IT Security?
    Speaker 4: Yes, please loop in IT. Also, Speaker 2, can you document the token flow bug and send it to the backlog?
    Speaker 2: Absolutely, I‚Äôll write up a ticket today. On a related note, the UI refresh for mobile is 80% complete. We need assets from the design team to finish.
    Speaker 1: Noted. Design, can you prioritize mobile assets?
    Speaker 5: We're on it. Expect initial drafts by Thursday. Also, we're revamping the color palette for better accessibility.
    Speaker 3: Speaking of accessibility, several users with screen readers had issues navigating the new dashboard.
    Speaker 4: That‚Äôs a critical blocker. Please coordinate with QA for accessibility testing.
    Speaker 2: Will do. On the infrastructure side, cloud costs spiked last week‚Äîprimarily from large batch data jobs.
    Speaker 1: Can someone analyze which jobs triggered the spike?
    Speaker 3: I‚Äôll take that action. Also, our release schedule is tight; do we have room to slip the October sprint?
    Speaker 1: Not really, but let‚Äôs flag high-risk items and communicate early.
    Speaker 5: Quick update: the marketing team requests a new landing page for the October campaign.
    Speaker 1: Please gather requirements and share a draft by next week.
    Speaker 2: One more thing: we have three open critical bugs in the API. Fixes should be ready by tomorrow.
    Speaker 4: Thanks, everyone. Let's summarize action items before we adjourn.
    Speaker 1: Sure! (1) IT Security to review authentication bug. (2) Design to deliver mobile assets and accessibility review. (3) QA to expand dashboard accessibility tests. (4) Speaker 3 to analyze cloud costs. (5) Speaker 2 to resolve API bugs. (6) Marketing draft due next week.
    Speaker 1: Anything else?
    Speaker 5: All good here.
    Speaker 2: Nothing from me.
    Speaker 3: No, thanks.
    Speaker 4: Meeting adjourned. Thanks all.
    """

## üí° Customization

- Swap in your favorite open-source LLM (e.g., [Mistral-7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2))
- Integrate with Slack, email, or your internal tools
- Add advanced topic detection or action item extraction

> ### üìù **Note: This is an *Extractive Summarization* Task**

**Abstractive summarization** means the AI generates new, concise summaries using its own words, capturing the key ideas rather than copying exact sentences from the original.

**Extractive summarization**, by contrast, selects and stitches together the most important sentences or phrases from the source text, without paraphrasing or rewording.

#### **Example:**

**Original Text:**  
"Speaker 1: Our quarterly profits rose by 20%. Speaker 2: That's a big win, but let's focus on improving customer retention going forward."

**Extractive Summary:**  
"Our quarterly profits rose by 20%. That's a big win, but let's focus on improving customer retention going forward."

**Abstractive Summary:**  
"Profits are up 20%, but the team plans to prioritize customer retention next."
